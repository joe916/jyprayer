                	<strong>[2]</strong> When evildoers assail me, uttering slanders against me, my adversaries and foes, they shall stumble and fall.

				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Be still before the Lord, and wait patiently for him.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Fret not yourself because of the wicked, be not envious of wrongdoers!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> For they will soon fade like the grass, and wither like the green herb.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Trust in the Lord, and do good; so you will dwell in the land, and enjoy security.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> He will bring forth your vindication as the light, and your right as the noonday.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Be still before the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over him who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> For the wicked shall be cut off; but those who wait for the Lord shall possess the land.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look well at his place, he will not be there.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> But the meek shall possess the land, and delight themselves in abundant  prosperity.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> The wicked borrows, and cannot pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;
<br />

</p>

</p>

</p>

				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy steadfast love; according to thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.  <br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight, so that thou art justified in thy sentence and blameless in thy judgment.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Fill me with joy and gladness; let the bones which thou hast broken rejoice.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.

PSALTER - Ps. 141, 142</p></strong>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> I cry to thee, O Lord; I say, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Give heed to my cry; for I am brought very low! Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> I call upon thee, O Lord; make haste to me! Give ear to my voice, when I call to thee!
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Let my prayer be counted as incense before thee, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord, keep watch over the door of my lips!
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Incline not my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Let a good man strike or rebuke me in kindness, but let the oil of the wicked never anoint my head; for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> When they are given over to those who shall condemn them, then they shall learn that the word of the Lord is true.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> As a rock which one cleaves and shatters on the land, so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> But my eyes are toward thee, O Lord God; in thee I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> I cry with my voice to the Lord, with my voice I make supplication to the Lord,
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> I pour out my complaint before him, I tell my trouble before him.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> When my spirit is faint, thou knowest my way! In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> I look to the right and watch, but there is none who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me, no man cares for me.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to thy name! The righteous will surround me; for thou wilt deal bountifully with me.

<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Glory be...
</p>

                  	<strong>[1]</strong> As it was...

<p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1 &amp; 2]</strong> I cry to thee, O Lord; I say, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.

                  	<strong>[1]</strong> O Lord my God, I cried to thee for help, and thou hast healed me. <br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast drawn me up, and hast not let my foes rejoice over me.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol, restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name.

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. <br />

                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Thou didst hide thy face, I was dismayed.
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> To thee, O Lord, I cried; and to the Lord I made supplication:

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> ìWhat profit is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise thee? Will it tell of thy faithfulness?
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me! O Lord, be thou my helper!

</p>
				  
				  <p class="large">
                  	<strong>[1]</strong> Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,
<br />
                  	<strong>[2]</strong> That my soul may praise thee and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to thee for ever.
